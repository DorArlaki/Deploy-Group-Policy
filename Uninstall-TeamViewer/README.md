# TeamViewer Removal Script (Startup GPO)

## Overview

Welcome to the TeamViewer Removal Script! This handy PowerShell script is designed to make your life easier by helping you remove TeamViewer from Windows computers using a startup Group Policy Object (GPO). It's like saying goodbye to TeamViewer with a click of a button.

Here's what this script does for you:

1. **Terminate Like a Pro**: It forcefully terminates any running TeamViewer processes. Say goodbye to those pesky background tasks!

2. **Silent Uninstall**: It silently uninstalls TeamViewer, sparing you from those annoying uninstaller prompts.

3. **Clean Slate**: It cleans up residual files and registry entries, leaving your computer squeaky clean.

## Prerequisites

Before you embark on your TeamViewer-removing adventure, make sure you've got the following:

- **Administrator Privileges**: This script needs to be run with administrator privileges. Don't worry; we've got you covered!

## Usage

Let's get started with a step-by-step guide:

1. **Download the Script**: First, grab the `Remove-TeamViewer.ps1` script from this repository and save it on your trusty administrative computer.

2. **Edit with Care**: Open the script in your favorite text editor (or choose the fanciest one). Make sure to check the following variable:

   - `$uninstallerPath`: Ensure it points to TeamViewer's uninstaller (`uninstall.exe`) correctly.

3. **GPO Magic**:

   - Fire up the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) on your domain controller. It's where the magic begins!

   - Create a new GPO or pick an existing one that you want to use for deploying the script.

4. **Add the Script**:

   - Navigate to the GPO's "Computer Configuration" > "Policies" > "Windows Settings" > "Scripts (Startup/Shutdown)".

   - Double-click "Startup" to edit the startup scripts.

   - Click "Add," and like a skilled explorer, find the `Remove-TeamViewer.ps1` script.

   - Click "OK" to add the script like a boss!

5. **Apply the GPO**:

   - Link the GPO to the Organizational Unit (OU) that houses the target computer objects.

   - Make sure the GPO applies correctly to the computers you're targeting.

6. **Deploy the GPO**:

   - Let's give it some time. Wait for Group Policy to refresh on your target computers, or use some IT magic with `gpupdate /force`.

   - Watch the script do its thing at startup, silently removing TeamViewer. It's like a ninja!

7. **Keep an Eye on It**:

   - Curious to know what's happening? Check out the Windows Event Viewer on your target computers. It might spill some secrets!

## Notes

- Remember, this script is designed for Windows computers and TeamViewer removal. Please use it responsibly and follow your organization's policies.

- Startup GPOs can affect system startup times, so test the script in a controlled environment before going all-in.

- Always have a backup of important data before running scripts that tinker with software.
