# TeamViewer Removal Script (Startup GPO)

## Overview

Welcome to the TeamViewer Removal Script! This PowerShell script is designed to help you remove TeamViewer from Windows computers by using a startup Group Policy Object (GPO). It ensures a seamless and hassle-free process, performing the following key tasks:

1. **Graceful Termination**: The script forcibly terminates any active TeamViewer processes to prepare for removal.

2. **Silent Uninstallation**: It silently uninstalls TeamViewer, sparing you from interactive uninstallation prompts.

3. **Thorough Cleanup**: The script diligently removes any residual files and registry entries to leave the system clean and pristine.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying this script, ensure you meet the following prerequisites:

- **Administrator Privileges**: To execute this script successfully, administrative privileges are required to facilitate the complete removal of TeamViewer.

## Usage

To make use of this script, follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. **Script Download**: Begin by downloading the `Remove-TeamViewer.ps1` script from this repository and save it to your administrative computer.

2. **Script Configuration**: Open the script in a text editor and verify that the `$uninstallerPath` variable points to the correct path of TeamViewer's uninstaller (`uninstall.exe`).

3. **Group Policy Object (GPO) Creation**:

   - Access the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) on your domain controller.

   - Either create a new GPO or select an existing one to use for deploying the script.

4. **Adding the Script to GPO**:

   - Navigate to the GPO's "Computer Configuration" > "Policies" > "Windows Settings" > "Scripts (Startup/Shutdown)".

   - Double-click "Startup" to edit the startup scripts.

   - Click "Add" and browse for the `Remove-TeamViewer.ps1` script.

   - Confirm your selection by clicking "OK."

5. **GPO Application**:

   - Link the GPO to the Organizational Unit (OU) that contains the target computer objects.

   - Ensure that the GPO is correctly applied to the intended computers.

6. **GPO Deployment**:

   - Allow some time for Group Policy to refresh on the target computers, or manually trigger a refresh using `gpupdate /force`.

   - The script will execute at system startup, efficiently removing TeamViewer without any user intervention.

7. **Monitoring Execution**:

   - Monitor the script's execution and check for any potential errors using the Windows Event Viewer on the target computers.

## Notes

- This script is specifically designed for removing TeamViewer from Windows computers. It is essential to use it responsibly and in compliance with your organization's policies.

- Be mindful of the potential impact on system startup times when using startup GPOs. We recommend thorough testing in a controlled environment before widespread deployment.
